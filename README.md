# EV_Load_Disambiguation
## By Gabriel Konar-Steenberg
This project, completed during a one-month mentorship with Ken Williams at NextEra Analytics in spring 2019, was an attempt to use my new machine learning knowledge to help solve a real-world problem. In brief, I simulated what household electrical consumption might look like if the households were charging electric vehicles, then attempted to reverse this process, taking the simulated load data and trying to decipher when the households were charging vehicles. Ultimately, my still fairly new machine learning skills were not enough to be able to do this with incredible success. However, I learned a lot about how machine learning is used in the real-world and developed my skills with tools such as Jupyter Notebooks. A full report of this project, including a more detailed description of the problem and possible ethical concerns, can be found at ```EV Load Disambiguation Demo.ipynb```.
